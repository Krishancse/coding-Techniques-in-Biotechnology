# Biotech Laboratory Temperature Control System

This repository contains a Java implementation of a simple temperature control system for biotech laboratories. The provided code demonstrates how coding and algorithms can be utilized to control, analyze, and simulate biotech equipment and processes.

## TemperatureControlSystem Class

The `TemperatureControlSystem` class is designed to manage and control the temperature of a biotech equipment. Here's an overview of the key components of the class:

- **Attributes:**
  - `setpoint`: The desired temperature that the system aims to maintain.
  - `tolerance`: The acceptable deviation from the setpoint.
  - `currentTemperature`: The current temperature of the system.

- **Constructor:**
  - Initializes the temperature control system with a specified setpoint and tolerance. The initial temperature is set to 25.0 degrees Celsius.

- **Methods:**
  - `getCurrentTemperature()`: Simulates reading the current temperature from a sensor.
  - `adjustHeatingCooling()`: Adjusts heating and cooling elements based on the current temperature in relation to the setpoint and tolerance.
  - `turnOnHeater()`, `turnOffHeater()`, `turnOnCooler()`, `turnOffCooler()`: Simulated methods to control the heater and cooler.
  - `main(String[] args)`: Demonstrates the usage of the temperature control system in a continuous loop, adjusting heating and cooling and printing the current temperature.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the temperature control system:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/biotech-temperature-control.git
   cd biotech-temperature-control
   ```

2. Compile and run the `TemperatureControlSystem` class:
   ```bash
   javac TemperatureControlSystem.java
   java TemperatureControlSystem
   ```

   This will simulate the temperature control system in action, displaying the current temperature and the status of the heater and cooler.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to fit the specific requirements of your biotech equipment. You can modify the setpoint, tolerance, and implement actual control mechanisms for the heater and cooler based on your laboratory setup.
